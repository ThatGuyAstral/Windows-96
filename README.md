# Windows 96

Windows 95, resurrected into it's nostalgic, yet sleek form.

This *belle pi√®ce de 
logiciel* has some useful features to it.

- FTP: Your scribbles and anime rants can be transferred over to your real PC.
- MS-DOS: I couldn't leave out W95's biggest backend, and I also plan on updating it with CUI color customization, and more.
- Lock Screen (both Desktop Mode and DOS Mode)

This is coming soon, so don't get too hyped.
